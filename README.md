## Project Overview

### What I Learned
This project is an interactive webpage designed to serve as a business card, promoting my personal brand and offering multiple methods of contact. It marked my first experience in web development, providing me with insights into the distinctions between HTML and CSS, as well as the importance of ensuring website accessibility. More specifically, this project taught me how to code in fonts and graphics and make them interactive through elements like clickable links and animations. Since completing this project, I have developed a deeper appreciation for the underlying complexity of the websites I encounter daily and I recognize the extensive effort required to bring them to life.

### Developing Personal Branding

The webpage features a personal logo that I previously designed. I chose to include it because the high contrast of width and color choice of my initials represents my aesthetic and identity as a designer. Prior to this project, the logo was only featured on my resume, and its integration into my digital business card strengthens my personal brand. The background animation was inspired by a desire to create another illustration element in the same style as my logo. I selected red fruits as the theme, as they embody a balance of softness and boldness, qualities that resonate with my design work and the overall aesthetic I aim to convey. In summary, this project was very helpful in expanding my personal brand and providing valuable skills in web development.
